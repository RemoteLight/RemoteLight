## New Home of RemoteLight 1.0
This is the new main repository for RemoteLight. However, there is still much to be done. ðŸš§

Please use the [old repository](https://github.com/Drumber/RemoteLight) until we are ready here.

## RemoteLight REST API
The [remotelight-api](/remotelight-api) module contains the REST API implementation for interacting with a RemoteLight instance. The API is documented according to the OpenAPI 3 specification. The documentation is available [here](/remotelight-api/docs/remotelight.yaml) and can be viewed on [this website](https://remotelight.github.io/api-docs).
